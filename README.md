Text Summarization Using Natural Language Processing And BeautifulSoup
Text summarization is a subdomain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with extracting summaries from huge chunks of texts. There are two main types of techniques used for text summarization: NLP-based techniques and deep learning-based techniques. In this project , I have implemented NLP-based technique for text summarization.
In this project firstly i collected data from a site through web scrapping using beautiful soup and then used natural language processing toolkit for summarization of the collected data
